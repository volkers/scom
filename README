# scom

Serial communication terminal for Linux.

Cutecom is really nice and I used it a lot. But I needed some
improvements and was interested trying it in Common Lisp and started
this project.

It is still at a very early stage though...

## Usage

Run make and use the created binary scom.

Sorry, there is no help yet.

## Dependencies

stty, sbcl and some libraries from quicklisp.
